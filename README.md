### Current List of Issues
1. The tooltip that appears when you send a message or archive a thread is not coloured correctly.
2. The window controls shift the icons to the bottom on hover.

### List of Features
1. Rounding out the send button to make it look more like gnome
2. Would like to create an option to move the window controls to the right for non mac users.
3. Replacing all the icons to make them look more like gnome.

While I am working on them, I have no css knowledge, I am just piecing code together from different projects. I would love any help I could get on these.
